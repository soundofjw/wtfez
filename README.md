## Crypto-Fez


### What is this?

2012's Fez is great.

It is my strong belief that the game contains a series of cryptographic and computer science problems
that will yield either A) a correction solution to the monolith or B) a friendly easter-egg.

To demonstrate this, I create scripts which process data I extract from Fez. For example,
[crypt.py](crypt/crypt.py) converts the open + closed door patterns of the crypt into 7 ascii characters.

The year is 2012 again.
X marks the spot.


### Installation

You just need numpy, and sometimes cv2.

```
pip install numpy
```

_you should manage your venv if you like to do that, explainning such is out of scope for my efforts._


### Roadmap

- [x] Crypt
- [ ] _Shapes to Tesselate_
- [ ] _Above and Beyond_


## Blender

You can use the `blender.py` script to load levels into Blender. :)
